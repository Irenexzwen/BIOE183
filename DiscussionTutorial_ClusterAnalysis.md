# Discussion Tutorial: Cluster Analysis Tools in R
In this tutorial, you will learn to:
  1) Set up R environment on your laptop,
  2) Learn the basics of the R language,
  3) Install and use packages for cluster analysis in R.

## What is R?
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. It includes:
- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

More information and documentation about R can be found on their [website](https://www.r-project.org/).

# Prepare the R working environment
First, download and install R on your computer from the website [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/). R is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

Next, download and install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio provides a convenient GUI to work with R and includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.

**Note:** For Windows users, it is recommended that you also install [RTools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/), as it is necessary for building R packages in Windows.

Once everything is installed, simply find and launch RStudio from your computer. 

# R basics
R is a command line driven program. Within the console, the user enters commands at the prompt (> by default) and each command is executed one at a time.

The workspace is your current R working environment and includes any user-defined objects (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, functions). At the end of an R session, the user can save an image of the current workspace that is automatically reloaded the next time R is started.

## Operators in R
### Arithmetic Operators:
|Operator|Description   |
|--------|--------------|
|+       |Addition      |
|-       |Subtraction   |
|*       |Multiplication|
|/       |Division      |
|^ or ** |Exponentiation|

### Logical Operators:
|Operator|Description             |
|--------|------------------------|
|>       |Greater than            |
|>=      |Greater than or equal to|
|==      |Exactly equal to        |
|!=      |Not equal to            |
