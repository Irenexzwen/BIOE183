# Homework 1

BENG 183 Applied Genomic Technologies (Fall 2019)
Due: October 8, 2019
Total: 10 points

## 1. DNA sequencing (DNA-seq)
### a.	What is the goal of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)? How does PCR relate to/help with DNA sequencing? (0.5 pt)
### b.	What role do dideoxynucleotides play in Sanger sequencing? What are the products of replicating AGACGTAAGCA with ddATP? (1 pt)
### c.	How does sequencing-by-synthesis differ from traditional Sanger sequencing with respect to their sequencing procedures? List at least three different aspects and briefly describe each aspect for both techniques. (1 pt)
### d.	What are advantages (and potential limitations) of Illumina sequencing vs. Sanger sequencing? List at least two advantages or limitations. (1 pt)

## 2. Gene expression and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
### a.	What are typical elements of a gene? (0.5 pt)
### b.	Briefly describe how gene expression can be regulated at the transcriptional level by transcription factors and at the translational level by alternative splicing. (1 pt)
### c.	On average, there are around 8 exons per gene. For a gene with 8 exons, assuming that all possible combinations of exons can be read through into proteins, how many types of proteins could potentially be made? (0.5 pt)
### d.	For the same gene, if exactly 5 exons are to be retained in the final transcript, how many types of proteins can be made? (0.5 pt) 
### e.	What does RNA-seq measure? (0.5 pt)
### f.	Choose the right sequencing technique (RNA-seq or DNA-seq) to measure each of the following: 1) genes that are differentially expressed between two individuals, 2) genetic variation across two species, 3) alternative splicing sites. (0.5 pt)
### g.	Briefly describe the experimental procedure of RNA-seq. (1 pt)

## 3. Online tutorial 1: Linux environment setup (https://github.com/Irenexzwen/BIOE183/blob/master/Tutorial1_Preparation.md)
Please go through Tutorial 1 and make sure you set up Linux environment (for Windows users) and install Miniconda together with several packages. Attach a screenshot(s) for each of the following:
### a.	Show the Python path after activating the “rnaseq” environment by using command “which python” (1 pt)
### b.	Show all the packages you installed for the “rnaseq” environment in Miniconda by using command “conda list” (1 pt)
