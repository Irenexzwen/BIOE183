# Working environment

Most bioinformatics analysis are deal with super large datasets (over few gigabytes even hundreds gigabytes), which is impracticle for manual checking and modification. 
In this case, most bioinformatics person put linux/Unix in their daily toolbox. With a lot commands that especially designed for large text file,
you're able to sort / extract / subsititute / get the head / get the tail / search super fast without loading the whole file into your memory 
( as you will load the big file into your memory if it is opened in a windows / mac text reader ).

Beyond that, Linux OS is also 
- convinent and compatible with mutiple versions of the same software.
- easy to build up pipelines for batch files processing. 
- super cool text processing softwares beyond your imagine. 
- Great habitat for a lot of open source softwares ( especially ones for bioinformatics ).
