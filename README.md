## Raw Sample files:
We will use a dataset from a previous [EBI traning courses](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/ebi-next-generation-sequencing-practical-course/rna-sequencing/rna-seq-analysis-transcriptome), the data is derived from sequencing of mRNA from zebrafish embryos in two diï¬€erent developmental stages. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform
and generated 76bp paired-end sequence data using poly-(A)+ selected RNA.
