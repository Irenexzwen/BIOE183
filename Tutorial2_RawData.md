# Tutorial2 Understand the Raw Data

In this tutorial you're gonna learn:
1. Experienmentally:
    1) The raw data for RNAseq data.
    2) Obtaining the raw data.
2. Bioinformatics:
    3) Raw data quality check.
    4) Raw data cleaning and preprocessing. 
    

## 1). RNAseq data
The RNA sequencing technology was designed to answer one of the fundamental questions in biology - 
which genomic loci are expressed at a specific time and what's the expression level of it? 

## 2). Obtaining the raw data
